## Product Description

The Meltdown Tracker is a tool for parents of children with autism and is designed to help them keep track of the frequency of their child’s meltdowns along with any environmental factors that were present at the time. It can be difficult to pinpoint what exactly might cause a child with autism to suffer a meltdown since every child is different and will react differently to environmental stimuli. This is especially true when the child is non-verbal and can't easily communicate what is upsetting them. It will likely take a long time and many meltdowns before the parent is finally able to identify the trigger accurately. This application aims to make that process quicker by giving parents an easy way to keep track of incidents and notice patterns.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Installation

#### 1. Clone Repo to your Local Machine and Install Dependencies
- Clone the repo to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
  git clone insert-your-SSH-URL-here
```
- Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the root repository:
```bash
  npm install && cd client && npm install
```

#### 2. Initialize a PostgreSQL Database
- Run PostgreSQL in the terminal and create a new database with the following command:
```bash
  CREATE DATABASE <database_name_here>;
```
#### 3. Create .env files and .gitignore
- Create a new .env file in the root repository and copy-paste the data from .env.example
  - LOCAL_HOST= the host number (127.0.0.1 for "local host")
  - LOCAL_PORT= your postgreSQL port number (default is 5432)
  - LOCAL_USER= your postgreSQL username goes here
  - LOCAL_PASSWORD= your postgreSQL password goes here
  - LOCAL_DATABASE= the name you gave your postgreSQL database
  - DATABASE_URL= (see [Deployment](#deployment))
  - NODE_ENV= (see [Deployment](#deployment))

#### 4. Run migrations
- In the terminal, run the following command to run the database migrations. This is populate the database you created in Step 3 with tables. Make sure you are in the root repository when you run this:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

#### 5. Setup a Firebase Project for User Authentication
- Create a new [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/) and register a new Web App to the project
- Enable "Add Authentication with Email/Password sign-in."
- In the Firebase Project Settings, click on General and scroll down until you see "// Your web app's Firebase configuration" and an object called firebaseConfig. Copy-paste the values from that object into your .env file in the client repository.

### Deployment

#### 1. Create New Web App

Create an account on [Render](https://render.com/) if you don't have one, then click "New +" and select "Web Service". After naming your app and selecting which GitHub repo to connect it to, set the Build and Start commands to 'npm run build' and 'npm start', respectively.

#### 2. Create a new PostgreSQL Database & Set Environment Variables

Once that's done, click "New +" again and this time select "PostgreSQL" and enter in the Name, Database, and User and click "Create Database" at the bottom of the page. Go to your Dashboard and click on the database. Scroll down and copy-paste the "Internal Database URL".

#### 3. Connect Web App and PostgreSQL Database

Now you need to connect the web application and the database together. Go to your Dashboard and click on the web application. On the left side of the screen, click on "Environment" and then add "DATABASE_URL" as the key and the Internal Database URL you copied earlier as the value. Add a second Environment Variable "NODE_ENV" as a key and "production" as its value.
